# Design Document: Shared Universal Time Scale Object

## 1. Overview
### Purpose
The goal is to ensure that the main chart (e.g., price chart) and sub-charts (e.g., volume chart) in a data visualization share the same x-axis time range, providing a synchronized and consistent user experience.

### Background
In time-series data visualizations, such as financial charts, the main chart and sub-charts must align on the x-axis (time axis) to allow users to correlate data effectively. For example, when a user zooms or pans the main chart, the sub-charts should reflect the same time range without discrepancies.

## 2. Design Goals
- **Synchronization**: Ensure the time axis of the main chart and sub-charts remains identical.
- **Performance**: Minimize redundant calculations and avoid frequent, unnecessary refreshes.
- **Flexibility**: Support interactive operations like zooming and panning.
- **Compatibility**: Work seamlessly with custom chart implementations or libraries like D3.js.

## 3. Implementation Approach
- **Shared Time Scale Object**: Create a single time scale object that both the main chart and sub-charts reference for mapping time data to pixel coordinates.
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Use an event mechanism to trigger synchronized rendering of all charts when the time scale changes.

## 4. Technical Details
### Time Scale Object
- **Properties**:
  - `domain`: The time range, represented as an array `[startTime, endTime]`.
- **Methods**:
  - `setDomain(newDomain)`: Updates the time range.
  - `timeToPixel(time)`: Converts a time value to a pixel coordinate based on the current domain and chart width.

### Chart Rendering
- Both the main chart and sub-charts use the shared `timeScale` object to calculate x-axis coordinates during rendering, ensuring consistency.

### Interaction Handling
- When the user zooms or pans the main chart, the `timeScale` objectâ€™s `domain` is updated, and both charts are re-rendered to reflect the new time range.

### Optimization Strategies
- **Batch Operations**: Group data processing and time scale updates to minimize DOM manipulations.
- **Debouncing**: Limit rendering frequency during rapid interactions (e.g., continuous zooming) to enhance performance.

## 5. Implementation Steps
### Step 1: Define the Shared Time Scale Object
Create an object to manage the time range and coordinate mapping.

```javascript
const timeScale = {
    domain: [startTime, endTime], // Initial time range
    setDomain: function(newDomain) {
        this.domain = newDomain;
    },
    timeToPixel: function(time) {
        const [start, end] = this.domain;
        const chartWidth = 600; // Example chart width in pixels
        return (time - start) / (end - start) * chartWidth;
    }
};
```

### Step 2: Render Charts Using `timeScale`
Both the main chart and sub-charts rely on `timeScale` for x-axis positioning.

```javascript
function renderMainChart() {
    // Use timeScale.timeToPixel(time) to draw the main chart
}

function renderSubChart() {
    // Use timeScale.timeToPixel(time) to draw the sub-chart
}
```

### Step 3: Handle User Interactions
Update the `timeScale` object and re-render both charts when the user interacts with the main chart.

```javascript
function onZoom(newDomain) {
    timeScale.setDomain(newDomain);
    renderMainChart();
    renderSubChart();
}
```

## 6. Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Clear and straightforward logic that is easy to implement and maintain.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces redundant calculations, improving performance, especially with large datasets.
- **Consistency**: Guarantees that the x-axis remains synchronized across all charts.

## 7. Applicable Scenarios
- Custom-built charts where developers control the rendering logic.
- Integration with libraries like D3.js, which natively support shared scale objects.

## 8. Considerations
- **Chart Width**: The main chart and sub-charts must have the same width to ensure accurate x-axis mapping. Adjust the mapping logic if widths differ.
- **Performance Monitoring**: For large datasets or frequent interactions, monitor rendering performance and apply debouncing or throttling as needed.
- **Smooth Interactions**: Ensure zooming and panning operations are responsive and fluid to maintain a good user experience.

## 9. Addressing Frequent Refreshes on Load
The shared time scale object mitigates frequent refresh issues during loading through:
- **Unified Data Processing**: All charts use the same time scale, eliminating the need for separate calculations.
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Updates to the time scale are computed once and reused across charts.
- **Synchronized Updates**: Changes to the time scale trigger simultaneous re-rendering of all charts, preventing visual inconsistencies.
- **Batch Processing**: Data updates and scale adjustments are grouped to minimize DOM operations.

## 10. Conclusion
By implementing a shared universal time scale object, the main chart and sub-charts can maintain synchronized x-axis displays efficiently. This approach simplifies the codebase, enhances performance by reducing redundant computations, and ensures a seamless user experience in interactive time-series visualizations.
